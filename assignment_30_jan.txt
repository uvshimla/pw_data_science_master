5.  A while loop in Python is used when you want to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. It allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met.
    Example : Printing numbers from 1 to 20

    count = 1

    while count <= 20:
        print(count)
        count += 1
6.  Here are three different patterns that can be printed using nested while loops in Python:

    Pattern 1: Triangle
    rows = 5
    for i in range(1, rows+1):
        for j in range(1, i+1):
            print("*", end="")
        print("")
    This will produce the following pattern:
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    Pattern 2: Inverted Triangle
    rows = 5
    for i in range(rows, 0, -1):
        for j in range(0, i):
            print("*", end="")
        print("")
    This will produce the following pattern:
    *****
    ****
    ***
    **
    *
    Pattern 3: Pyramid
    rows = 5
    for i in range(1, rows+1):
        for j in range(rows-i):
            print(end=" ")
        for j in range(i):
            print("*", end=" ")
        print("")
    This will produce the following pattern:
        *
       * *
      * * *
     * * * *
    * * * * *
7.  count = 10

    while count >= 1:
        print(count)
        count -= 1
8.  count = 10

    while count >= 1:
        print(count)
        count -= 1
